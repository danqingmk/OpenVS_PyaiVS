# PyaiVS unifies AI workflows to accelerate ligand discovery

## Overview

**PyaiVS** is a comprehensive and modular machine learning framework tailored for molecular virtual screening (VS) and classification/regression model development. With a single line of code, users can:

- Rapidly build classification or regression models for various datasets  
- Automatically identify and recommend optimal algorithms  
- Access a suite of integrated machine learning and deep learning models  
- Utilize commonly used molecular descriptors and fingerprints  
- Choose from multiple dataset splitting strategies  
- Efficiently screen large-scale compound libraries

## Basic Workflow

The workflow of PyaiVS consists of two main stepsï¼š

1. Train models and optimize parameters
2. Screen compounds using the best-performing model

Below is a code example:

```bash
from script import model_bulid, virtual_screen

# Step 1: Train models and find optimal parameters
model_bulid.running('your_dataset.csv',      # Input dataset
                    out_dir='./dataset/abcg2/working_example',     # Output directory
                    run_type='param',        # Parameter optimization mode
                    cpus=4)                  # Number of CPUs to use

# Step 2: Generate results and get model recommendations
model_bulid.running('your_dataset.csv', 
                    out_dir='./dataset/abcg2/working_example',
                    run_type='result',       # Result computation mode
                    cpus=4)

# Step 3: Screen compounds using the best model
virtual_screen.model_screen(model='SVM',      # Best-performing algorithm (e.g., SVM, selected based on evaluation metrics)
                            split='random',   # Best data splitting method (e.g., 'random', selected based on metrics)
                            FP='ECFP',       # Best fingerprint type (e.g., ECFP, selected based on metrics)
                            model_dir='./dataset/abcg2/working_example/model_save',  # Path to the saved model
                            screen_file='./database/compound_library.csv',  # Compound library to be screened
                            sep=';',          # File delimiter
                            smiles_col='smiles')  # Column name containing SMILES strings
``` 

## Output

After running the full workflow, the following results will be generated:

### Model Optimization Results

Stored in the specified output directory:

```bash
./dataset/abcg2/working_example/
â”œâ”€â”€ param_save/       # Optimal hyperparameters for each model
â”œâ”€â”€ model_save/       # Saved model files
â”œâ”€â”€ result_save/      # Performance metrics for all models
```

### Model Recommendation (Printed to Console)

The models are ranked by performance metrics such as AUC-ROC, F1-score, accuracy, and MCC:

```bash
      model    des   split   auc_roc  f1_score       acc       mcc
    2   SVM  ECFP4  random  0.969047  0.903497  0.917723  0.831872
    4   DNN  ECFP4  random  0.961781  0.881708  0.898430  0.426201
                                  â€¦
```

### Virtual Screening Results

Saved in the screening output folder:

```bash
./dataset/abcg2/working_example/screen/
â””â”€â”€ screened_compounds.csv   # Screened compounds passing the threshold
```
